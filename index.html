<h1>RxJS challenge:</h1>

<p>Before starting the challenge, click on the Fork button above to copy this project to your workspace.</p> <p>Open the console below to see results.</p>
<p>The challenge is to use RxJS operators to manipulate the output of the source stream, following the rules below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discard any number ending with 0 or 5.</li>
  <li>For odd numbers, print them to the console in groups of 3. Example: [3, 27, 61]</li>
  <li>For even numbers, repeat each emittion 2 times.</li>
  <li>The maximum number of elements printed to the console is 30, then the emittions must stop, and the word 'complete' must be printed 1x only. (element = A group of odd numbers || an even number)</li>
</ul>

<p>Example of output:</p>
